The ND Memory Game
- by Jillian Montalvo & Camilla Tassi

To run the program, run:
	python2.6 memory.py

After the command is run, the menu screen will open displaying the three options: Join, Host, or Quit Game. Using the arrow keys and enter key, choose "Host Game" if you'll be hosting the game and "Join Game" to join it. Because this is a two player game, only one person can host and only one can join per session. In addition, you cannot join a game if one isn't being hosted.

The host's gameplay window will then open and a 'waiting for player 2' screen will show. The game board with the cards will display as soon as the 2nd player joins the game and is connected.
At the bottom of the screen, a message will display which user's turn it is. Player 1 begins and can start playing the game by selecting two cards - which will be flipped face up upon clicking. Player 2 is not allowed to flip cards until the end of Player 1's turn but he/she is able to see the cards Player 1 flips in real time on their screen - and vice versa.

If a match is made, the cards will disappear and a point will be added to the player's score. If it is not a match, the cards will flip over face down again. The game continues until the board is cleared and there are no more cards left. This will prompt a 'Game Over' screen and the game is finished.

------ NOTE: Testing ----
The game has been tested on both personal laptops/student machines and the
Engineering Library's machines. It was found that, while the game worked on the student machines, the connection was much slower and the Fitzpatrick computers provided a faster and optimal gameplay.
